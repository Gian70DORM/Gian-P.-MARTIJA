<h1 align="center">Having You Near Me</h1>

<h2 align="center">By:Air Supply</h2>

<p align="center"> I came to you and never asked too much<br>
Wondering what you would say<br>
Hoping you'd understand<br>
It's not a role I usually play<br>
</p>

<p align="center">Don't speak too much of what's been going on<br>
The past is over and gone<br>
Give me your troubled mind<br>
You know it's used<br>
I can do so much for you<br>
</p>

<p align="center">I want you having you near me, holding you near me<br>
I want you to stay and never go away<br>
It's so right having you near me, holding you near me<br>
I'll love you tonight, it feels so right, feels so right<br>
</p>

<p align="center">You're brave to say that you get lost in love<br>
But you opened your heart to me<br>
Underneath all you feel, you know<br>
How deep our love could be<br>
</p>

<p align="center">Tonight we'll touch until it's time to go<br>
Then I'm leaving it up to you<br>
Even a fool would know that I'm not through<br>
I can do so much for you<br>
</p>

<p align="center">I want you having you near me, holding you near me<br>
I want you to stay and never go away<br>
It's so right having you near me, holding you near me<br>
I'll love you tonight, it feels so right, feels so right<br>
</p>

<p align="center">Having you near me, holding you near me<br>
I want you to stay and never go away<br>
It's so right having you near me, holding you near me<br>
I'll love you tonight, it feels so right, feels so right<br>
